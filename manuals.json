You can literally be playing within a few minutes.\n\n---\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Creating an Account</h3>\n\nFirst of all you must create your account.\n\nThis can be done by clicking the \"play game\" link from the RuneScape main page. This will take you to a screen which gives you the option to play the free game or the member's game.\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/free-game.jpg\" align=\"right\" />\nYou will need to select the free game option for now, but as soon as the registration process is over you may create a members account by going to our [members sign up area](#TODO)\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n---\n\nThis will take you to our world select screen.\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/world-select.jpg\" align=\"right\" />\nAll of the worlds are identical in terms of content, the only difference being the players playing on each one. Select one of the worlds by clicking one of the green links.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n(Any one will do, although some people find choosing a world with a location nearest to them gives them the best game playing speed)\n\nThe initial download process will then start. During the download a grey security box will pop up. You will be asked 'Do you want to install and run Runescape?' You should check the box that appears next to 'Always trust content from Jagex Ltd' and click OK.\n\n---\n\nWhen the game has loaded you will be presented with a login screen. You will need to choose the option of \"New User\" and then decide on a username and password for your account. You should then tick the box that agrees to our terms of service and click the submit button.\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/design-character.jpg\" align=\"right\" />\n\nYou will then be presented with a character design page\n\nYou should use the right and left arrows to toggle each option until you are happy with your characters look.\n\nYou can change all of the physical appearances of your character as viewed from the screenshot to the right. There is an option in game for you to change your appearance again, though beware it will cost you RuneScape currency for such a privaledge so make sure your character design choices are ones you like!\n\nOnce you have finished you should click the submit button which will launch your character into our tutorial Island!\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n---\n\nTutorial Island is the first place your character will enter in RuneScape. Here you will be introduced to the basics of RuneScape and also participate in some of the skills and trades available. You will be taken through a variety of skills by each instructor which will include casting spells, fishing, mining, combat and much more!\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/tutorial-island.jpg\" align=\"right\" />\nThis should only take about 15 minutes to complete and you will then catch the boat to Lumbridge town where your RuneScape adventure will truly begin!\n\nFrom there you will be able to interact with all of our players, and design your own journey in Runescape!\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n---\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Further References</h3>\n(All accessible from main page)\n\n<a class=\"rsc-centre-text\" href=\"/manual\"><h4>RuneScape Manual</h4></a>\nHere you can find information on game controls, skills, quests, rules of conduct and many helpful guides.

So why not [get started](/manual/about/getting-started)?\n","what-is-runescape":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">What is RuneScape?</h2>\n\nRunescape is a massive multiplayer adventure, with monsters to kill, quests to complete, and treasure to win. You control your own character who will improve and become more powerful the more you play. This isn't a game where everything that happens is pre-determined. What you do in the world is up to you!\n\nRuneScape isn't a game you can just finish in a week, and we are adding in more features and quests on a regular basis to ensure there is always something new for you to try!\n\nSo, read on and most importantly, have fun!\n\nAndrew Gower (Head of Development)\n\n---\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Game Features</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Skills</h4>\n\nThere are plenty of skills within RuneScape that you can work at. You could train your character to be an all rounder or you can specialize and perhaps earn a living practicing a craft such as cooking or crafting. The choice is yours and with the large selection of skills available you will definately be spoilt for choice. You can find more information on our skills [here](/manual/skills).\n\n<h4 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Quests</h4>\n\nMany of the characters in the game can give you quests to go on, each with different rewards. If you are brave you can search for riches in the dungeons or sewers but make sure you are well armed! Try your hand at archery, or learn some magic spells to give yourself an extra advantage. More information on our quests can be found [here](/manual/quests).\n\n<h4 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Global community</h4>\n\nThe game is multiplayer which means you will meet many other people in the world who you can communicate and trade with. Make new friends and go adventuring together to stand a better chance against the stronger monsters. Perhaps you want to make your money trading valuable goods with others. Or if you like taking risks, you can choose to fight with like-minded people to try and steal their treasure.\n\n(Please see our [safety guide](/manual/guides/safety) so you can be both safe and have fun.)\n\n---\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">RuneScape Ingredients</h3>\n\n* Over 730,000 map tiles make up the huge world\n* Over 1080 frames of animation for the monsters and players\n* Over 1000 different objects to find and trade\n* Over 22,000 items of scenery with over 950 different designs\n* Over 3200 characters all walking around the map, with over 700 different designs\n"},"controls":{"banks":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">The Bank of Varrock</h2>\n\nYou can only hold 30 items at once in RuneScape and carrying around all your money is risky, because when you die you drop what you are holding. Therefore you need to have somewhere to store your extra items and to stash your treasure.\n\nFor this purpose the bank of Varrock has opened branches all over RuneScape. Branches of this bank can be found in Varrock, Falador, Edgeville, and Draynor village. When you wish to access your in-game bank account, just walk to the nearest bank and speak with one of the banker characters inside.\n\n---\n\n<p class=\"rsc-centre-text\"><a href=\"/manual-images/bank.png\"><img src=\"/manual-images/bank.png\" alt=\"Bank interface in game\" /></a></p>\n\nThe bank screen shown above will appear, and you can now choose to deposit and withdraw items. All the items in your account, as well as the items in your inventory will be shown. The bankers aren't fussy and will safely store anything from runes to big piles of coal!\n\nEach item has 2 numbers next to it. The green number indicates the number in your bank account, and the blue number indicates the number that you are holding. Click on an item to select it. You can then use the deposit and withdraw buttons at the bottom of the screen to move it in and out of your bank account.\n\nTo deposit a single item press the button labelled \"One\", to deposit a large stack of items just use the larger numbers. (E.g in the example above pressing the \"100\" button would deposit 100 coins into the bank account.)\n\nThe banks are free to use, so making use of them to safely store your extra items is a very good idea!\n","camera":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Rotating the camera</h2>\n\nThe camera in the game can be rotated by pressing the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. Regularly rotating the camera to get the best view of the action is a good idea, and is sometimes essential to see objects which you would otherwise miss.\n\nThe camera defaults to running in 'automatic mode'. In this mode the game will attempt to automatically detect if a building is blocking your view, and will rotate the camera to a better angle.\n\nHowever if you want more control you can use the options menu to switch the camera to 'manual mode'. In manual mode you will sometimes find that tall buildings obscure your view. If this happens just press either the left or right arrow key on your keyboard to move the camera around the building.\n\n<div class=\"rsc-row\">\n\n<div class=\"rsc-col rsc-col-50\" style=\"padding:0;\">\n<div class=\"rsc-row\">\n<div class=\"rsc-col rsc-col-36\" style=\"padding:0;\">\n<a href=\"/manual-images/camera-obscured.jpg\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/camera-obscured.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rsc-col rsc-col-64\">\nHere the building obscures the screen.\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"rsc-col rsc-col-50\" style=\"padding:0;\">\n<div class=\"rsc-row\">\n<div class=\"rsc-col rsc-col-36\" style=\"padding:0;\">\n<a href=\"/manual-images/camera-clear.jpg\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/camera-clear.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rsc-col rsc-col-64\">\nRotating the camera solves the problem!\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n","friends":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Using the friends list and ignore list</h2>\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/friends.png\" align=\"right\" />\n The **friends list** allows you to keep in contact with the friends you make in RuneScape. To add a friend to your list click on the button marked \"click here to add a friend\", and enter the name of the person you want to add. You will now be informed whenever your friend logs in or out of runescape. (unless their privacy settings block this - see 'runescape options' below). Players on your list who are currently playing are shown in green, and players who are not currently playing are shown in red. You can also send a private message to a person on your list who is playing. Just click on the players name and when prompted, type in the message you want to send.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nIf there is a particular player who you do not wish to receive messages from then first click on the button marked \"Ignore\", to access the ignore list. Then click on the button at the bottom marked \"click here to add a name\" and enter the name of the person that you wish to block.\n","inventory":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Using your inventory</h2>\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/inventory.png\" align=\"right\" />\nWhenever you pick-up or purchase an item it will be added to your inventory. To view the items in your inventory, just point your mouse at the backpack icon in the top right corner of the screen. Your inventory has 30 slots available. Large items will take up one inventory slot each. Small items such as money can all be stored in just one slot, in which case a yellow number at the top left of the slot indicates how many of that item you are currently holding.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nTo use an item you are holding, open your inventory, and then click on the item you wish to use. You can then click on another item or person to use the two together. To drop an item you are holding, select the \"drop\" option, and then click on an empty spot on the ground, and your character will attempt to place it where you indicated.\n\n---\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/inventory-wield.png\" align=\"right\" />\nArmour and weapons are an important aspect of the game. The weaponary you are wielding can often make the difference between winning and losing a battle. To wield a weapon you must first be holding it, then just open your inventory and click on the item that you wish to wear or hold. The background will turn red to indicate that the item is being worn.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n","map-view":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Using the map view</h2>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/map.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/map.png\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nTo aid your exploration of the world we have also included a map of the surrounding area which will show you what is nearby. To view the map - point your mouse at the 'map icon' at the top-right hand corner of the screen. A map of the surrounding area will appear. Clicking on the map will make your character attempt to walk to the place you have selected. If the route is blocked, for example by a closed door then your character won't move and you will need to go a different way or remove the blockage (e.g by opening/unlocking the door)\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nThe map shows nearby items of interest as coloured dots:\n\n* Objects are shown as red dots.\n* Monsters and game-characters are shown as yellow dots.\n* Fixed locations such as trees & tables as light-blue dots.\n* Other nearby players are shown as white dots.\n","movement":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Moving around the world</h2>\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/walk.png\" align=\"right\" />\nIn order to do anything in the game, you will first need to learn how to get around the world. Fortunately movement is quite simple, and is just a case of pointing the mouse-cursor at the point on the ground where you would like to go, and clicking with the left mouse button.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nA small yellow cross will briefly appear to indicate that the request was received, then a few moments later your character will start to move. If the yellow cross appears, but your character doesn't start walking immediately, then just wait a few seconds, as it may take a few moments before anything happens. Your character will walk until his/her feet are at the point where you clicked on the ground, and will automatically work out how to walk around any trees or obstacles which may be in the way.\n\n---\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Interacting with items and scenery</h2>\n\nTo interact with an item in the world first point your mouse at it. Look at the top left of the screen and you will see a list of things you can do with that item. For instance if you point at an object you will see that you can 'Take' the object. To choose the first option listed, click it with the LEFT mouse button. To choose from one of the other available options click with the RIGHT mouse button, and choose the option you want from the menu which appears. When you request the action a red cross will briefly appear to indicate it was received. You may have to wait a few seconds for your character to perform the requested action.\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/interact.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\nFor instance, in the example on the right, the player is pointing at one of the characters in the game, and in this case is given the default choice of \"Talk-to Lowe\". By LEFT clicking on the character the player could start a conversation and perhaps buy some arrows. By RIGHT clicking, the player could instead access a menu with other available actions.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n","options":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">RuneScape options</h2>\n\nThe options menu allows you to change the settings on your account, and optionally activate various privacy settings. You should also always use the options menu to logout after playing.\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/options.png\" align=\"right\" />\nThe 1st option allows you to toggle the camera between 'auto' and 'manual' mode. In auto mode the camera will attempt to automatically rotate so that your character is always visible.\n\nThe 2nd option allows you to toggle between using two mouse buttons to control the game, or just one. In single button mode the menu will always appear when you click on more than one item. Some people find this easier, and it's also handy if your mouse only has one button!\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nThe 3rd option allows you to change your password. (See our [security tips](/manual/guides/secure) for important information on keeping your password secure).\n\nThe next 3 options are privacy settings. They are applied to all people who are not on your friends list. You can use these to block chat and/or trade messages from all people who you haven't listed as friends.\n\nThe privacy options can be used to prevent you from being shown as online on other people's friends list when you login. Once activated, only people you have listed as friends will be notifed that you have entered or left RuneScape.\n\nThe final option logs you out of the game. You can't log out whilst fighting, or just after combat, but at all other times you are allowed to leave. When quitting RuneScape you should always use the logout feature, to ensure that your player is saved properly, ready for the next time you play.\n","shops":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">RuneScape shops</h2>\nScattered throughout RuneScape there are many shops where you can buy and sell items. Most shops will specialise in a certain type of item. For instance, the sword shop will only buy and sell swords. In addition to the specialist shops there are several \"General stores\" which will buy and sell almost anything. However, items in the general stores normally cost slightly more, and they will pay less for items that you sell to them. If you take the trouble to find the right shop you can often get a better deal.\n\nTo access the shop you must talk to the shop-keeper in the store and choose the conversation option to indicate that you wish to buy or sell. A screen like the one shown on the next page will appear.\n\n<p class=\"rsc-centre-text\"><a href=\"/manual-images/shop.png\"><img src=\"/manual-images/shop.png\" alt=\"Shop screen in game\" /></a></p>\n\nThis window shows all the items you can buy and sell at the current shop. In the example here the player is using a general store which means that there is a variety of different items shown.\n\nNext to each item there are two numbers. The green number indicates the number that the shop has in stock that are available for purchase. The blue number indicates the number that you are holding, which you could sell back to the shop.\n\nClick on an item with the left mouse button. The item will be highlighted, and the purchase and sale prices will be indicated at the bottom of the screen. These two prices will not be the same since the shop buys at a lower price than it sells out (the shopkeeper is making a hefty profit!). You can then choose to buy or sell the item by clicking on the relevant buttons.\n\nThe price of items in the shop also depends on the current stock. If a shop has 500 swords in store it will sell them at a reduced rate to try and clear stock. However, it will also pay less for them if you are selling.\n","stats":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Understanding your players stats</h2>\n\n<img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/stats.png\" align=\"right\" />\nTo view the stats menu point your mouse at the graph icon and select the stats tab. The stats menu shows your skills and equipment status.\n\nYour skills will increase depending on how you play the game. For instance if you fight a lot of monsters your attack, defense, strength and hits will increase. If you cook food your cooking will increase, cutting down trees increases your woodcutting etc...\n\nTo determine how close you are to advancing a level, point your mouse at the skill you are interested in. The number of experience points you have earnt so far, and the number you need for the next level will be shown at the bottom of the panel.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nYour **equipment status** indicates the power of the items you are currently wearing/wielding in your inventory. The armour value is the total of all the defensive items you are currently wearing, and modifies your defense in battle. Weapon aim indicates how easy the weapon you are holding is to aim and modifies your attack skills, whereas weapon power shows how much damage the weapon you are holding can do and modifies your strength skill.\n\nYou should try to wear the items which give the largest values in the equipment status section. A fully equipped fighter is able to wear a helmet, body-armour, leg-armour and cape, as well as wielding a weapon and shield.\n","trading":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Trading with other players</h2>\nTrading items with other players is an important aspect of RuneScape and will often allow you to buy and sell your items at a better price than the shops offer. Many rare items cannot be purchased in the shops at all and can only be obtained by finding them yourself, or by purchase from another player.\n\nBefore you start trading you need to find a buyer (or seller). For instance, if you have mined some coal and you want to sell it, you could try standing in a busy area and saying \"Coal for sale!\"\n\nOnce you have found someone to trade with, click on their character with the right mouse button, and select the \"trade-with\" option. The other player will be informed of your request, and to accept your trade they must click on your character and also select the \"trade-with\" option.\n\n---\n\n<p class=\"rsc-centre-text\"><a href=\"/manual-images/trade.png\"><img src=\"/manual-images/trade.png\" alt=\"The first screen of the trade window in game\" /></a></p>\n\nAt this point a screen similar to the one shown above will appear. All the items in your inventory are shown to the right, and the items being traded are shown to the left. To add an item to your offer click on it in the inventory box. If you wish to add multiple items (e.g a stack of coins), then hold down the mouse button over the stack until the desired number has been added. To remove an item from your offer, just click on it in the offer window and it will be removed.\n\nThe items your opponent has offered are shown in the bottom left hand window. Once you are happy with the proposed exchange, press the green \"accept\" button.\n\n---\n\n<p class=\"rsc-centre-text\"><a href=\"/manual-images/trade-confirm.png\"><img src=\"/manual-images/trade-confirm.png\" alt=\"The second screen of the trade window confirmation items + amounts\" /></a></p>\n\nA final confirmation like the one shown above will appear. This clearly lists everything which is being swapped and gives you one last chance to check you are getting the trade you expected. You should read this information carefully, and then once you are sure you are happy with the trade, press the green \"accept\" button.\n\nRemember that there is no way to reverse a trade if you later change your mind. So be careful! Giving items in return for information, or with the promise of getting them back is very risky. Not all RuneScape players are honest, and you could end up losing your items for nothing if you do this.\n"},"skills":{"agility":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Agility guide - (members skill)</h2>\n\n*Agility is only available to RuneScape members. Please subscribe to get this feature.*\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/rope-swing.jpg\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/rope-swing.jpg\" alt=\"A player about to use a rope swing\" align=\"right\" /></a>\nAgility is a skill that can be used to get over, up and through various obstacles, often as a short cut, or to get into new areas.\n\n\nTypical examples of where you use your agility skill are to squeeze through a pipe, swing on a rope over a hole, or use some handholds to climb up a wall.\n\nJust click on the obstacle you wish to get past, and if you have the appropriate agility skill level you will attempt it.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nYou will never fail some obstacles once you reach the appropriate agility level. On other obstacles it is possible to fall off, which will cause you to lose hitpoints.\n\nA good way to advance your agility skill is to use the obstacle courses. By going round the obstacle course in the correct order you can get an agility experience bonus from the course. This is in addition to the normal agility skill experience you get from attempting single obstacles.\n\nPlayers with low-levels of ability might want to use the obstacle course in the tree gnome stronghold.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/obstacle-course.jpg\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/obstacle-course.jpg\" alt=\"A player about to use an obstacle course\" align=\"left\" /></a>\n\nAt level 35 you can also enter the obstacle course at the barbarian outpost.\n\nAgility is a fatigue skill, which means that as you use it your character will slowly tire and eventually need to find a bed to rest on. Eating food will also reduce your character's fatigue slightly. For more information on fatigue please see our fatigue guide.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n","cooking":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Cooking skill</h2>\n\nThere is a variety of different foods you can cook in RuneScape. Food is useful because eating it will heal lost hit points. As you practice your cooking, your character will get better. You will burn food less often, and you will be able to make better food which heals you more.\n\nTo cook food you will need to use one of the many stoves which are scattered around the map. Alternatively if there aren't any stoves nearby you can build a campfire and use that. For more information on building fires please see our [Firemaking section](/manual/skills/firemaking).\n\nA guide to the different foods you can cook is shown below.

Gems, gold bars, silver bars, leather and clay are all used in crafting.\n\n---\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Pottery</h3>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/crafting-pottery.png\" alt=\"Player firing pot in a pottery oven\" align=\"right\" />\n\nBowls, pots and pie dishes can all be made by crafting. Clay is obtained by mining. To make the clay workable it needs to be softened first. Use a jug of water with the clay and it will be turned into soft clay. Take the clay to a potters. There is one in the barbarian village. Use the clay on the potter's wheel and select what object you would like to make. If you have the correct crafting level you will make an unfired piece of pottery. Use it on the pottery oven and as long is doesn't crack upon heating you will have made yourself a nice new piece of pottery.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Leather</h3>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/crafting-leather.png\" alt=\"Player firing pot in a leather oven\" align=\"left\" />\n\nLeather is made from cow hides, so you will need to find a cow field and kill some cows. Once you have a cow hide, take it to the tannery in Al Kharid. You can then craft your leather into leather armour, boots or gloves. You will need to get a needle and some thread from a crafting shop. Select the needle from your inventory and then as long as you have some thread you will be given a choice of leather objects to make.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Gems</h3>\nGems are rare objects you will occasionally find, they can be made more valuable by cutting them. Once a gem is cut it can also be used when you are making gold jewelry. You will need to buy a chisel from a general store or a crafting shop. Select the chisel from your inventory and then the gem you wish to cut. If you find your crafting level is not high enough to cut the gem you may want to make a bit more pottery or leather to raise your crafting level first.\n\n<br />\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Holy symbols</h3>\nYou need a crafting level of 16 to craft silver bars. To make silver bars see the mining and smithing guides. You will need a holy symbol mould which can be bought from a crafting shop. Then use your silver bar on a furnace and you will be able to make a holy symbol of Saradomin.\n\n<img src=\"/manual-images/crafting-wool.png\" alt=\"Player spinning wool\" align=\"left\" />\n\nYou can either sell your holy symbol to the general store or you can make it into an object that makes your prayers last longer. If you want to use your holy symbol you will need some string. To make string, buy a pair of shears from a general store. Use the shears on a sheep to get some wool.\n\nUse the wool on a spinning wheel to spin it into a ball. Then you can use your ball of wool on your holy symbol to give it a string.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<img src=\"/manual-images/crafting-symbol-bless.png\" alt=\"Player getting a holy symbol blessed from a monk\" align=\"right\" />\n\nFinally you will need to get your holy symbol blessed. This can only be done by taking it to a monk called Brother Jered. Brother Jered is upstairs in the monastery. You will need a prayer level of 31 to get in to talk to him.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Jewelery and amulets</h3>\n<img src=\"/manual-images/crafting-jewelry.png\" alt=\"Player choosing jewlry crafting options\" align=\"left\" />\nTo make gold bars see the mining and smithing guides. You can make amulets, necklaces and rings from gold bars. Buy the appropriate moulds from a crafting shop. Use a gold bar on a furnace and select if you want to make an amulet necklace or ring. Then you will be asked if you want to put in a gem in the jewelry you are making. Putting gems in your gold jewelry can increase the smithing level required quite a lot, it also increases the value of what you are making.\n\nAll the gold jewelry can be sold for a good price, but amulets with jewels in them can also be made into useful enchanted amulets which give various bonuses. First of all your amulet will need a string, this is made in the same way as the string for the holy amulets of Saradomin. Then it can be enchanted using the [magic skil\f](/manual/skills/magic).\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Glassmaking</h3>\n\n<p class=\"rsc-centre-text\">\n<em>Glassmaking is only available to RuneScape members.</em><br />\n<em>Please subscribe to get this feature.</em>\n</p>\n\nTo make some glass, you will first need to get some seaweed. This can be obtained by big net fishing, or found on Entrana Island. Heat the seaweed, to get soda ash.\n\nThen use a bucket on a sandpit, to get a bucket of sand. With both soda ash and sand in your inventory, you can then use a furnace on either one to make molten glass.\n\nUse this molten glass with a glass-blowing pipe, which can also be found on Entrana. You will then be asked what object you would like to make.\n\n<h4 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Glassobjects</h4>\n\n<div class=\"rsc-skill-table\">\n\n|Food|Purpose|Crafting level|\n|---|---|---|\nBeer glass<br /><img src=\"/items/620.png\" alt=\"Beer glass\" />|Fill them with beer from beer barrels|1|\nVial<br /><img src=\"/items/465.png\" alt=\"Empty vial\" />|Useful in Herblaw|33|\nOrb<br /><img src=\"/items/611.png\" alt=\"Unenchanted orb\" />|Can be enchanted andthen put on the end of battlestaffs<br />(See crafting battlestaffs)|46|\n\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Battlestaffs</h3>\n\n<p class=\"rsc-centre-text\">\n<em>Battlestaff crafting is only available to RuneScape members.</em><br />\n<em>Please subscribe to get this feature.</em>\n</p>\n\nFirst get an unpowered orb (see glassmaking).\n\nYou will need to enchant the orb. You can make fire orbs, earth orbs, water orbs and air orbs. Take an orb to a magic obelisk (either the obelisk of air, the obelisk of earth, the obelisk of water or the obelisk of fire) and cast the appropriate orb enchantment spell on the obelisk. This requires a high magic level (see magic guide). The obelisks are not in easily accesible areas.\n\nThen buy a battlestaff from a staff shop on a members server. Use the battlestaff with a charged orb to make a battlestaff.\n\nYou will need the following crafting levels to attach the orbs to the staffs.\n\n<div class=\"rsc-skill-table\">\n\n||Battlestaff|Crafting level requirement|\n|---|---|---|\n|<img src=\"/items/616.png\" alt=\"Battlestaff of water\" />|Water|54|\n|<img src=\"/items/618.png\" alt=\"Battlestaff of earth\" />|Earth|58|\n|<img src=\"/items/615.png\" alt=\"Battlestaff of fire\" />|Fire|62|\n|<img src=\"/items/617.png\" alt=\"Battlestaff of air\" />|Air|66|\n\n</div>\n","fatigue":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Fatigue</h2>\n\nSome skills give you fatigue as you use them.\n\nAs your fatigue level gets higher you will not be able to use these skills as you will be too tired.\n\nThe best way to reduce your fatigue is to find a bed and to click to rest on it. This will reduce your fatigue back down to zero percent.\n\nEating food will also reduce your fatigue. Some foods reduce fatigue more than others. Foods such as Pies, pizzas and curry are among the best foods for reducing fatigue.\n","fighting":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Initiating combat</h2>\nTo fight a monster or character in the game just point your mouse at your opponent and select the 'attack' option. Not every character in the game can be attacked, so if no attack option is visible on the menu, then the character is probably part of some quest or shop, and is not designed to be fought.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/combat-hover.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/combat-hover.png\" alt=\"Hovering the mouse over a skeleton in game\" align=\"left\" /></a>\n\nWhen you point the mouse at your opponent their relative strength will be indicated next to their name. In the example here the rat can be seen to be a level-8 monster. This is also coloured coded to help you decide if you should fight or not. It your opponent is weaker than you the indicator is shown in green, for equal opponents it is shown in yellow, whereas for stronger opponents it is shown in red.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">During the fight</h2>\n<a href=\"/manual-images/combat-style.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/combat-style.png\" alt=\"Combat style interface in game\" align=\"right\" /></a>\nOnce you are fighting a monster an indicator will be displayed at the top left of the screen which you can use to select your combat style. Choosing 'accurate' will make you more likely to hit your opponent. Choosing 'aggressive' means that when you do hit your opponent you are likely to do more damage. 'Defensive' makes your opponent less likely to hit you. Whereas 'controlled' simply improves all three by a smaller amount. The combat style you select also affects which stats you gain experience points in when you kill the monster.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/combat-fight.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/combat-fight.png\" alt=\"A player fighting a guard in game\" align=\"left\" /></a>\nThe strength of each combat participant is indicate by a horizontal bar above their head. If your bar is entirely green you are not hurt, it will turn red as you are hit. If the bar goes entirely red your character will die. A number will also briefly appear over you whenever you are hit by your opponent, indicating how many points of damage you have just sustained.\n\nIf you find you are losing the battle, then you can run away by clicking on the ground. You can't run away during the first few seconds of combat, but after that you are free to retreat. If you do retreat it's best to keep moving until you are some distance from your opponent as they may well pursue you.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Dying</h2>\nDying isn't much fun, so we recommend you avoid it. However most players will sooner or later get into a fight they can't win and end up losing all their hitpoints. Luckily death in RuneScape isn't permanent and after a few moments you will reappear in Lumbridge.\n\nYou keep all your stats and skills, BUT you drop the items you are carrying! It is unlikely you will be able to retrieve them so we recommend you keep as many of your valuables in the bank as possible. If you haven't attacked any other players recently (see section on player killing) you will also keep your 3 most valuable items. But you won't keep stackable items like coins, runes, arrows, etc...\n","firemaking":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Firemaking Guide</h2>\n<a href=\"/manual-images/fire.gif\"><img src=\"/manual-images/fire.gif\" alt=\"A burning in-game fire\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nMaking a fire is useful for cooking food without having to go and find a range. To make a fire drop some logs on the ground. Then use a tinderbox with the logs.\n\nYou will then attempt to light the fire.\n\nYour chance of lighting the fire depends on your firemaking level.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n","fishing":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Fishing guide</h2>\nFishing is a quick way of getting food to heal yourself. There are various sorts of fishing spots in the game. You will need to buy the correct fishing equipment to match the fishing spot. Fishing equipment can be bought from fishing shops.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/fishing-menu.png\"><img src=\"/manual-images/fishing-menu.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Right click menu on a fishing spot\" /></a>\nTypically a fishing spot will have a left click option and a right click option. These options are net, bait, harpoon, lure and cage.\n\nClick on the correct option and if you have the correct equipment you will attempt to catch a fish.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nFishing is a fatigue skill which means as you fish your character will slowly tire and eventually need to find a bed to rest on. Eating food will also reduce your character's fatigue slightly. For more information please see the [fatigue section](/manual/skills/fatigue).\n\nYou can find below the guides to each of the different types of fishing you can do in Runescape.\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Types of Fishing</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Net Fishing</h3>\n\n**Location:** found in many sea fishing locations\n\n**Required items:** Net\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** Shrimps 1, Anchovies 15\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Sea bait fishing</h3>\n\n**Location:** found in many sea fishing locations\n\n**Required items:** fishing rod, fishing bait\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** Sardine 5, Herring 10\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Fly fishing</h3>\n\n**Location:** found in many river locations\n\n**Required items:** fly fishing rod, feathers\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** Trout 20, salmon 30\n\n*(You will use up 1 feather every time you catch a fish)*\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">River bait fishing</h3>\n\n**Location:** found in many river fishing locations\n\n**Required items:** fishing rod, fishing bait\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** Pike 25\n\n*(You will use up 1 bait every time you catch a fish)*\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Harpoon fishing</h3>\n\n**Location:** found in Karamja and in many sea fishing locations on the members servers.\n\n**Required items:** harpoon\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** tuna 35, swordfish 50\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Lobster fishing</h3>\n\n**Location:** found in Karamja and in many sea fishing locations on the members servers.\n\n**Required items:** lobster pot\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** Lobster 40\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Big net fishing - (members only)</h3>\n\n**Location:** found at Catherby and the fishing guild.\n\n**Required items:** Big net\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** boots 16, gloves 16, seaweed 16, Mackerel 16, Oyster shell 16, Cod 23, Bass 46\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text rsc-underline-text\">Shark fishing - (members only)</h3>\n\n**Location:** found at Catherby and the fishing guild.\n\n**Required items:** harpoon\n\n**Fishing level requirements:** Shark 76\n","fletching":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Fletching guide - (members skill)</h2>\n\n*Fletching is only available to RuneScape members.

Depending on the type of tree you chop down you can get different sorts of logs. Next use a knife with the logs to cut them into either a shortbow or a longbow. To make a bow string you need to find a flax plant and use it with a spinning wheel. Finally add the string to the bow to complete it.\n\nRarer types of wood are harder to acquire, but make better bows which shoot more accurately. The table on the next page lists the different types of bow you can make.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h4 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Different types of bow</h4>\n\n<div class=\"rsc-skill-table rsc-fletching-table\">\n\n|Bow type||Fletching level to make|Ranged level to wield\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Bow|<img src=\"/items/188.png\" alt=\"Regular longbow\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" />|Shortbow: Level 5<br />Longbow: Level 10|Any|\n|Oak bow|<img src=\"/items/648.png\" alt=\"Oak longbow\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" />|Shortbow: Level 20<br />Longbow: Level 25|Shortbow: Level 5<br />Longbow: Level 10|\n|Willow bow|<img src=\"/items/650.png\" alt=\"Willow longbow\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" />|Shortbow: Level 35<br />Longbow: Level 40|Shortbow: Level 15<br />Longbow: Level 20|\n|Maple bow|<img src=\"/items/652.png\" alt=\"Willow longbow\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" />|Shortbow: Level 50<br />Longbow: Level 55|Shortbow: Level 25<br />Longbow: Level 30|\n|Yew bow|<img src=\"/items/654.png\" alt=\"Yew longbow\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" />|Shortbow: Level 65<br />Longbow: Level 70|Shortbow: Level 35<br />Longbow: Level 40|\n|Magic bow|<img src=\"/items/656.png\" alt=\"Magic longbow\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" />|Shortbow: Level 80<br />Longbow: Level 85|Shortbow: Level 45<br />Longbow: Level 50|\n\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Making arrows</h3>\nTo make an arrow-shaft just use a knife with some ordinary logs. Add a feather to the arrow shaft, and finally add an arrow-head to complete the arrow. Arrow heads can either be purchased from the member's archery shop, or smithed at an anvil. Better arrow heads will inflict more damage, but you will require a better bow to fire them.

To be able to use them you will first need to use your herblaw skill to identify them. Just click on a herb to identify it and if you are high enough level it will then become an identified herb type. As your herblaw level gets higher you will be able to identify more and more different herbs.\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Mixing potions</h3>\n<a href=\"/manual-images/mix-potion.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/mix-potion.png\" alt=\"Inventory ingredients for mixing an attack potion\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nYou will need a vial.

To make potions you will need a combination of one identified herb and one other ingredient as shown in the table below. You must add your herb to your vial of water first and then the other ingredient. As you reach higher levels you will be able to make more types of potions.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Potion ingrediants</h3>\n\n<div class=\"rsc-skill-table rsc-herb-table\">\n\n|Potion type|Level|Herb needed||2nd ingredient|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Attack potion|3|Guam Leaf|<img src=\"/items/270.png\" alt=\"Eye of newt\" />|Eye of Newt|\n|Cure poison potion|5|Marrentill|<img src=\"/items/473.png\" alt=\"Ground unicorn horn\" />|Ground unicorn horn|\n|Strength potion|12|Tarromin|<img src=\"/items/220.png\" alt=\"Limpwurt root\" />|Limpwurt root|\n|Stat restore potion|22|Harralander|<img src=\"/items/219.png\" alt=\"Red spider's eggs\" />|Red spider's eggs|\n|Defense potion|30|Ranarr weed|<img src=\"/items/471.png\" alt=\"White Berries\" />|White Berries|\n|Restore prayer potion|38|Ranarr weed|<img src=\"/items/469.png\" alt=\"Snape Grass\" />|Snape Grass|\n|Super attack potion|45|Irit Leaf|<img src=\"/items/270.png\" alt=\"Eye of newt\" />|Eye of newt|\n|Poison antidote|48|Irit Leaf|<img src=\"/items/473.png\" alt=\"Ground unicorn horn\" />|Ground unicorn horn|\n|Fishing potion|50|Avantoe|<img src=\"/items/469.png\" alt=\"Snape Grass\" />|Snape Grass|\n|Super strength potion|55|Kwuarm|<img src=\"/items/220.png\" alt=\"Limpwurt root\" />|Limpwurt root|\n|Weapon poison|60|Kwuarm|<img src=\"/items/472.png\" alt=\"Ground bluedragon scale \" />|Ground bluedragon scale|\n|Super defense potion|66|Cadantine|<img src=\"/items/471.png\" alt=\"White Berries\" />|White Berries|\n|Ranging potion|72|Dwarf weed|<img src=\"/items/501.png\" alt=\"Wine of Zamorak\" />|Wine of Zamorak|\n\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Ground Ingredients</h3>\n\nThe unicorn and blue dragon scale need to be ground before they can be used in the potions. To grind them use the pestle and mortar bought from the herblaw shop.\n\n<h3 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Weapon Poison</h3>\n<a href=\"/manual-images/poisoned.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/poisoned.png\" alt=\"A player receiving poison damage from a scorpion\" align=\"left\" /></a>\n\nThe weapon poison can only be used on arrows and on daggers. Weapon poison will only affect players and not monsters. Players can be poisoned by other player's poisoned weapons or by a poisonous npc[sic].\n\nA player will slowly take damage from the poison until it either wears off or they drink a poison antidote or cure poison potion. The poison antidote also grants a small immunity so that the drinker cannot be poisoned for a short while. The cure poison potion does not grant this immunity.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n","magic":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Using magic spells</h2>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/magic.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/magic.png\" alt=\"Magic interface in game\" align=\"right\" /></a>\nPointing at the spell book item brings up the magic menu. From here you can select spells to cast. If it's not already selected click on the 'magic' tab to show your magic spells.\n\nBelow this there is a list of all the spells available. The colour of the spell name indicates if you can cast or not. If the name appears in black your magic level is not yet high enough, and you need to practice with the lower level spells before you can cast it. If the name appears in white your player is sufficiently good at magic, but you are not holding the required runes to cast the spell. If the name appears in yellow then you have everything you need, and the spell is ready for casting.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nTo cast the spell just click on the spell name, and then click on your desired target in the main game window. Some spells can only be cast on hostile monsters, other spells can only be cast on yourself, so experiment to see what targets are valid for each spell.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/magic-hover.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/magic-hover.png\" alt=\"Hovering over a spell in the magic interface in game\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n For more information on a spell move your mouse cursor over the spell. A description of the spell and a list of which are runes are required is shown at the bottom of the window. Each required rune has 2 numbers shown above it, the 1st number indicates how many of that rune you have, and the 2nd number indicates how many you require. The numbers will be drawn in red for runes which you do not have a sufficient number of to cast the spell. Runes can be found in many places, the easiest way to obtain the low level runes is to buy them from the magic shop in Varrock. The high level runes can only be obtained by killing the correct monsters.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Rune Types</h2>\n\nTo cast spells in the game you need the correct runes. Each of the runes has a different power, and is used for a different category of spell. Information about each of the runes is shown below:\n\n<img src=\"/items/34.png\" alt=\"Earth rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Earth rune  - One of the 4 elemental runes. Can be replaced by a staff of earth.\n<img src=\"/items/33.png\" alt=\"Air rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Air rune - One of the 4 elemental runes. Can be replaced by a staff of air.\n<img src=\"/items/32.png\" alt=\"Water rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Water rune - One of the 4 elemental runes. Can be replaced by a staff of water.\n<img src=\"/items/31.png\" alt=\"Fire rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Fire rune - One of the 4 elemental runes. Can be replaced by a staff of fire.\n<img src=\"/items/36.png\" alt=\"Body rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Body rune - Required for curse spells.\n<img src=\"/items/35.png\" alt=\"Mind rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Mind rune - Required for strike spells.\n<img src=\"/items/46.png\" alt=\"Cosmic rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Cosmic rune - Required for amulet enchant spells.\n<img src=\"/items/41.png\" alt=\"Chaos rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Chaos rune - Required for bolt spells.\n<img src=\"/items/40.png\" alt=\"Nature rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Nature rune - Required for object conversion spells.\n<img src=\"/items/38.png\" alt=\"Death rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Death rune - Required for blast spells.\n<img src=\"/items/42.png\" alt=\"Law rune\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" /> Law rune - Required for teleport spells.\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Notes about magic</h2>\n\n* After casting magic, your opponent will normally attack you. Therefore magic is a good way to start combat as it can give you a good head start.\n* Sometimes spells will fail to work. If a spell fails you keep your runes, but you can't perform magic for another 20 seconds. The higher level spells are more likely to fail, but as your magic ability improves you will have a greater chance of casting spells successfully.\n\nAlso wearing magic amulets and wielding magic staffs improves your chance of casting a spell successfully.\n","mining":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Mining guide</h2>\n\nThe mining skill is used to get ores and metals from rocks. The ores can then either be sold or made into different objects using the smithing and crafting skills. To mine, the only object you will need is a pickaxe. These can be bought at the axe shop in Lumbridge for 1 gold coin. Rocks can be found at the various mining sites in the RuneScape world.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/mining-prospect.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/mining-prospect.png\" alt=\"Hovering over the prospect option in game\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nIf you right click on a rock, you will get the option to prospect it. When you successfully prospect a rock, you will be told what sort of ores you are able to mine from it. Sometimes you will fail to find the ore, so you may need to try prospecting the rock several times to make sure there really is nothing there that you can mine. If your mining level is too low to mine an ore you will not be able to successfully prospect for it either.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/mining.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/mining.png\" alt=\"A player mining a rock\" align=\"left\" /></a>\n\nTo mine a rock select your pickaxe from your inventory then left click on the rock you wish to mine. If there is an ore in that rock there is a chance you will extract it, provided your mining is high enough to mine that particular ore. Ore is quite hard to get out of rocks - it might take quite a few attempts before you meet with success. As your mining level gets higher it will become slowly easier. Once someone has taken from a rock there will be no ore available to mine from it for a short while, wait a bit and you will be able to mine ore from it again.\n\nMining is a fatigue skill which means as you mine your character will slowly tire and eventually need to find a bed to rest on. Eating food will also reduce your character's fatigue slightly. For more information on fatigue please see our fatigue guide.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Mining levels</h2>\n\n<div class=\"rsc-skill-table\">\n\n||Ore|Level required|\n|---|---|---|\n|<img src=\"/items/149.png\" alt=\"Clay ore\" />|Clay|1|\n|<img src=\"/items/150.png\" alt=\"Copper ore\" />|Copper Ore|1|\n|<img src=\"/items/202.png\" alt=\"Tin ore\" />|Tin Ore|1|\n|<img src=\"/items/151.png\" alt=\"Iron ore\" />|Iron Ore|15|\n|<img src=\"/items/383.png\" alt=\"Silver\" />|Silver|20|\n|<img src=\"/items/155.png\" alt=\"Coal\" />|Coal|30|\n|<img src=\"/items/152.png\" alt=\"Gold\" />|Gold|40|\n|<img src=\"/items/153.png\" alt=\"Mithril ore\" />|Mithril|55|\n|<img src=\"/items/154.png\" alt=\"Adamantite ore\" />|Adamantite|70|\n|<img src=\"/items/409.png\" alt=\"Runite ore\" />|Runite|85|\n\n</div>\n","prayer":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Using prayers</h2>\n\nAs well as using magic spells you can also pray to the gods of RuneScape to give you an advantage. To view the available prayers point at the spell book item at the top of the screen, and click on the 'prayers' tab to show the list.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/prayer-menu.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/prayer-menu.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Prayer list in game\" /></a>\n\nThe list of spells available is colour coded to indicate which prayers you can use. If the name appears in black your prayer level is not yet high enough. If the name appears in white the prayer is available to use.\n\nEach of the prayers can be turned on or off individually. Whilst a prayer is in use, your player will be given an advantage depending on the prayer. To activate a prayer just left click on it. The name will turn green to indicate the prayer is active. Click on the prayer again to deactivate it.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/prayer-altar.png\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/prayer-altar.png\" align=\"left\" alt=\"An altar in game\" /></a>\n\nWhilst you have prayers active your prayer-points will slowly drain down to zero. The more prayers you use at once, and the more powerful they are, the faster your points will drain. When you run out of prayer-points all the effects will be deactivated, and can't be used again until you recharge your prayer-points.\n\nTo recharge your prayer-points you must find a church in the game, and left click on the altar to recharge. You are then ready to use the different prayers again.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nTo use the prayers for longer, and to use the higher-level prayers in the game you need to increase your total prayer-points. You do this by burying bones from monsters you kill. Take the bones, and then left click on them in your inventory to bury them. You need to bury quite a lot of bones to advance a level, but luckily they are quite easy to come by.\n","ranging":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Ranging Guide</h2>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/ranged.gif\"><img class=\"rsc-image\" src=\"/manual-images/ranged.gif\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nThe ranged skill is used for attacking players or monsters from a distance with either bows and arrows or crossbows and crossbow bolts. This skill is useful if you want to help a friend fight. More than 1 person can attack an monster or player by using the ranged skill.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\nMonsters attacked by ranged will run directly to attack you in hand to hand combat where you will not be able to use your bow. If you shoot at a monster from the other side of a fence or piece of furniture then the monster will not be able to get to you and you can keep on shooting it.\n\nA number of your arrows will land on the ground by your target so you can go and use them again, however some will be lost as they are damaged upon impact.\n\nFor further information on the selection of bows available to make and also level requirements needed to range please see our [fletching guide](/manual/skills/fletching).\n","smithing":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Smithing guide</h2>\n<a href=\"/manual-images/smithing-smelting.png\"/><img src=\"/manual-images/smithing-smelting.png\" alt=\"A player smelting a bronze bar\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nThe smithing skill is used to convert ores, obtained by [mining](/manual/skills/mining), into weapons and armours. Many players find that making equipment and selling it to shops and other players is a good way to make money.\n\nSmithing has two stages: smelting and forging. Smelting converts your ores into bars. This is done at furnaces. To convert your ore into bars select an ore in your inventory then left click on a furnace.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n---\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Ores/smithing levels chart</h2>\n\nYou will need different combinations of ores and different smithing levels to make each bar. Some of these requirements are shown on the next page. There are even more bars to make at higher levels.\n\n<div class=\"rsc-skill-table\">\n\n||Bar|Ores required|Level|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|<img src=\"/items/169.png\" alt=\"Bronze bar\" />|Bronze|1 Tin ore, 1 Copper ore|1|\n|<img src=\"/items/170.png\" alt=\"Iron bar\" />|Iron|1 Iron ore (50% chance of success)|15|\n|<img src=\"/items/384.png\" alt=\"Silver bar\" />|Silver|1 Silver|20|\n|<img src=\"/items/171.png\" alt=\"Steel bar\" />|Steel|2 coal, 1 Iron ore|30|\n|<img src=\"/items/172.png\" alt=\"Gold bar\" />|Gold|1 Gold|40|\n|<img src=\"/items/173.png\" alt=\"Mithril bar\" />|Mithri|4 Coal, 1 Mithril ore|50|\n|<img src=\"/items/174.png\" alt=\"Adamantite bar\" />|Adamantite|6 Coal, 1 Adamantite ore|70|\n|<img src=\"/items/408.png\" alt=\"Runite bar\" />|Runite|8 Coal, 1 Runite ore|85|\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Forging items</h2>\n\nYou will need a hammer which can be bought from any general store. To convert your bars into armour and weapons you must forge them at an anvil.\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/smithing-forge.png\"/><img src=\"/manual-images/smithing-forge.png\" alt=\"A player using an iron bar on an anvil\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nSelect a bar from your inventory, then select an anvil. In the top left you will be given a series of choices to decide what sort of equipment you would like to make. You will also be shown how many bars are needed to make types of object.\n\nSelect what you would like to make and provided you have the required smithing levels and number of bars, your object will be made.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"/manual-images/smithing-menu.png\"/><img src=\"/manual-images/smithing-menu.png\" alt=\"A player deciding between swords in the smithing menu\" align=\"left\" /></a>\n\nThe smithing levels required to forge a metal type are the same as those required to smelt it. However at the levels given you will only be able to forge the most basic items in that metal (mostly daggers). A few levels off these base smithing levels you will be able to make a wider variety of things. For example at smithing level 4 you will be able to make bronze short swords.\n\nThe gold and silver bars are not used to smith weapons instead they are used in the [crafting skill](/manual/skills/crafting).\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n","thieving":"<h2 class=\"rsc-centre-text\">Thieving guide - (members only)</h2>\n\n*Fletching is only available to RuneScape members.
