<h2 class="rsc-centre-text">Fishing guide</h2>
Fishing is a quick way of getting food to heal yourself. There are various sorts of fishing spots in the game. You will need to buy the correct fishing equipment to match the fishing spot. Fishing equipment can be bought from fishing shops.

<a href="/manual-images/fishing-menu.png"><img src="/manual-images/fishing-menu.png" align="right" alt="Right click menu on a fishing spot" /></a>
Typically a fishing spot will have a left click option and a right click option. These options are net, bait, harpoon, lure and cage.

Click on the correct option and if you have the correct equipment you will attempt to catch a fish.

Fishing is a fatigue skill which means as you fish your character will slowly tire and eventually need to find a bed to rest on. Eating food will also reduce your character's fatigue slightly. For more information please see the [fatigue section](/manual/skills/fatigue).

You can find below the guides to each of the different types of fishing you can do in Runescape.
