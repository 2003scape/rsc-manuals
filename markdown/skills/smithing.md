The smithing skill is used to convert ores, obtained by [mining](/manual/skills/mining), into weapons and armours. Many players find that making equipment and selling it to shops and other players is a good way to make money.

Smithing has two stages: smelting and forging. Smelting converts your ores into bars. This is done at furnaces. To convert your ore into bars select an ore in your inventory then left click on a furnace.

<h2 class="rsc-centre-text">Ores/smithing levels chart</h2>

You will need different combinations of ores and different smithing levels to make each bar. Some of these requirements are shown on the next page. There are even more bars to make at higher levels.

<h2 class="rsc-centre-text">Forging items</h2>

You will need a hammer which can be bought from any general store. To convert your bars into armour and weapons you must forge them at an anvil.

<a href="/manual-images/smithing-forge.png"/><img src="/manual-images/smithing-forge.png" alt="A player using an iron bar on an anvil" align="right" /></a>

Select a bar from your inventory, then select an anvil. In the top left you will be given a series of choices to decide what sort of equipment you would like to make. You will also be shown how many bars are needed to make types of object.

Select what you would like to make and provided you have the required smithing levels and number of bars, your object will be made.

The smithing levels required to forge a metal type are the same as those required to smelt it. However at the levels given you will only be able to forge the most basic items in that metal (mostly daggers). A few levels off these base smithing levels you will be able to make a wider variety of things. For example at smithing level 4 you will be able to make bronze short swords.

The gold and silver bars are not used to smith weapons instead they are used in the [crafting skill](/manual/skills/crafting).
