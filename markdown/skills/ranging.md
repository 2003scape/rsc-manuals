The ranged skill is used for attacking players or monsters from a distance with either bows and arrows or crossbows and crossbow bolts. This skill is useful if you want to help a friend fight. More than 1 person can attack an monster or player by using the ranged skill.

Monsters attacked by ranged will run directly to attack you in hand to hand combat where you will not be able to use your bow. If you shoot at a monster from the other side of a fence or piece of furniture then the monster will not be able to get to you and you can keep on shooting it.

A number of your arrows will land on the ground by your target so you can go and use them again, however some will be lost as they are damaged upon impact.

For further information on the selection of bows available to make and also level requirements needed to range please see our [fletching guide](/manual/skills/fletching).
