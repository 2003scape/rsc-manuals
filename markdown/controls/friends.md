<h2 class="rsc-centre-text">Using the friends list and ignore list</h2>

<img class="rsc-image" src="/manual-images/friends.png" align="right" />
 The **friends list** allows you to keep in contact with the friends you make in RuneScape. To add a friend to your list click on the button marked "click here to add a friend", and enter the name of the person you want to add. You will now be informed whenever your friend logs in or out of runescape. (unless their privacy settings block this - see 'runescape options' below). Players on your list who are currently playing are shown in green, and players who are not currently playing are shown in red. You can also send a private message to a person on your list who is playing. Just click on the players name and when prompted, type in the message you want to send.

If there is a particular player who you do not wish to receive messages from then first click on the button marked "Ignore", to access the ignore list. Then click on the button at the bottom marked "click here to add a name" and enter the name of the person that you wish to block.
