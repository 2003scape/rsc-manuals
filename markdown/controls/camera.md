<h2 class="rsc-centre-text">Rotating the camera</h2>

The camera in the game can be rotated by pressing the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. Regularly rotating the camera to get the best view of the action is a good idea, and is sometimes essential to see objects which you would otherwise miss.

The camera defaults to running in 'automatic mode'. In this mode the game will attempt to automatically detect if a building is blocking your view, and will rotate the camera to a better angle.

However if you want more control you can use the options menu to switch the camera to 'manual mode'. In manual mode you will sometimes find that tall buildings obscure your view. If this happens just press either the left or right arrow key on your keyboard to move the camera around the building.
