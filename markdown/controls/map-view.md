To aid your exploration of the world we have also included a map of the surrounding area which will show you what is nearby. To view the map - point your mouse at the 'map icon' at the top-right hand corner of the screen. A map of the surrounding area will appear. Clicking on the map will make your character attempt to walk to the place you have selected. If the route is blocked, for example by a closed door then your character won't move and you will need to go a different way or remove the blockage (e.g by opening/unlocking the door)

The map shows nearby items of interest as coloured dots:

* Objects are shown as red dots.
* Monsters and game-characters are shown as yellow dots.
* Fixed locations such as trees & tables as light-blue dots.
* Other nearby players are shown as white dots.
