<h2 class="rsc-centre-text">What is a virtual world?</h2>

A virtual world is a place where thousands of people from across the globe can interact with each other at the press of a button. Not only will you meet players of all ages and backgrounds, but your actions will have a real impact on shaping the environment and the development of RuneScape.

Whatever the time you log in there will be thousands of online players in our community to interact with. Combine that with over a 1000 different objects to find/trade and a large landscape to explore, you will always have something exciting to attend to.

You have the absolute freedom and opportunity to create your own virtual life. So why not [get started](/manual/about/getting-started)?
